From HW2 but also heavily applied in hw3:
1. ChatGPT was used as a reference.
2. Questions asked included help with code syntax, understanding code snippets from 
    non-AI resources online (like asking "What does this code do"). ChatGPT also helped with debugging technical issues
    with importing/using packages and running the program (like asking "Why am I getting this error?"). Syntax related 
    prompts/questions included "examples of pytest to test API", and getting info from API requests like "headline': article['headline']['main']", 
    and examples of integrating it with the frontend in App.svelte (onMount stuff).
    
    HW3 specific questions included general questions on how to connect to mongodb, as well as syntax structure on async functions that
    dealt with inserting and retrieving data. Questions were also asked on unit testing and syntax to set up mock environments.
    More specific lines are cited on the pytest file.
3. ChatGPT was extremely helpful in resolving issues with running the program and understanding syntax patterns to reproduce
    in our own code. It was also a tremendous help in setting up and running/connecting to mongodb.
